# BC Unit Framework

## Overview
BC Unit Test is a testing framework, built-in both C# that allows software developers to create and run their tests in either language. Visual Studio can easily access the extension and run it whenever they like on their created test methods, giving them a simple way of checking for bugs or discrepancies in their code. It also includes an optional ordering system that allows the user to choose which tests are to be run either before or after others and in what specific order.
